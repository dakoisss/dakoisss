# 👾 Dakoi — Pentester / Security Tools Developer

## 🌀 About

Hi! I’m **Pol**, though more commonly known online as **Dakoi**.  
I'm a **penetration tester** and **security tool developer** with a strong focus on **offensive security**. I thrive on breaking, understanding, and rebuilding systems through curiosity and experimentation.

My work includes manual exploitation, reverse engineering, and fuzzing, and I'm passionate about converting those insights into practical tools and solutions.  
Outside of projects, I actively participate in **CTF competitions**, contribute to community knowledge bases, and enjoy mentoring others on their cybersecurity journey.

Security, to me, is not just a job—it’s a mindset and a never-ending learning process.
