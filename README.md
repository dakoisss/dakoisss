# 💻 Dakoi | Offensive Security Engineer & Tool Developer

## 🌀 About
Hi! I’m **Dakoi**.

I am a **Penetration Tester** with expertise in **advanced offensive security**, specializing in **manual exploitation**, **reverse engineering**, and developing tools primarily in **Rust** and **Python**. I thrive on breaking, understanding, and rebuilding systems through curiosity and experimentation.

My work involves converting exploitation insights into practical solutions. I actively participate in **CTF competitions** and contribute to the community, mentoring others on their cybersecurity journey.

Security, to me, is not just a job—it’s a mindset and a never-ending learning process.
