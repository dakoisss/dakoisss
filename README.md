# 👋Hi, im Dakoi (New acc)
### 💻 Software Engineer | Penetration Tester | OSCP & OSEP Certified | Security & Automation Enthusiast

I'm a software engineer specializing in offensive cybersecurity, with a deep focus on pentesting, reverse engineering, and automation. 
My work combines designing and building robust software with the discipline of analyzing and exploiting real-world vulnerabilities. 
I’m not just interested in breaking things—I’m driven to understand why systems fail and how to build them to resist attacks.

### ⚙️ Projects and Key Experiences

🔍 Custom Payload Generator – A framework to craft adaptable payloads and evade EDRs, driven by adversarial thinking.

🔎 ReconFramework – An advanced reconnaissance and enumeration toolset tailored for penetration testing.

🔬 Reversing Challenges – In-depth binary analysis using RE techniques, with a focus on understanding not just the "how" but the "why" behind the code.

🛡️ SecureOps – An initiative to blend DevOps workflows with offensive cybersecurity, automating vulnerability discovery and exploitation.

🌐 Community – Active contributor to forums and open source projects related to pentesting and tool development, sharing real-world, practical knowledge.


### My Professional Approach
I go beyond theory and conventional methods by constantly updating my skillset with the latest techniques and trends in offensive security and software development. 
Security is a dynamic challenge that demands creativity, discipline, and a critical mindset—qualities I bring to every project. 
My goal is always to deliver practical, adaptable solutions that address complex, evolving threats.
